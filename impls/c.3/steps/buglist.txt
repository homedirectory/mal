- All globally bound values have ref count of 2, instead of 1.

+ TCO doesn't isolate procedure envs properly:
    (def! f1 (fn* (x) (f2)))
    (def! f2 (fn* () x))
    (f1 10) ;=> 10


+ Address boundary error for def! inside a procedure
FIX: prevent early free of return value of apply_proc, which could happen if it
     was the same value as an argument; e.g., ((fn* (x) x) 10)
